### Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project aims to reinvent the deep learning wheel, entirely from scratch in C with full test coverage. I have always been facinated with the inner workings of deep learning, to greater understand the so called black box (as well as showcase my technical knowledege of low level programming) I decided to create a codebase from scratch that would be able to train a deep neural network on data from a csv file using gradient decent. Since mathmatical errors within individual functions would be hard to catch (as they would result in models learning slower or not at all), I decided to build this project with full test coverage.


### Features:
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Low Level:**  
Since this project is build in C all memory allocation and garbage collection is done manually and all data structures are custom made. For example each neural network is a structure composed of layers that are each two allocated array's, one of weights and the other of biases. Each of these structures is allocated and freed using functions that accept the size of the network's layers as inputs.
